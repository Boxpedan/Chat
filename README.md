# Chat
a chat application for school project

This project is final project from my software engineering class.
I didn't finish all of  the work this time. The software has some
bugs happened in this version. I might work on the project in future.

The single chat cannot work right now, the other works can work. 
The mutiple means talk to all of the people that who use the application.
Status will display the user status that they are online or not.
History will read the file from the base and then display the 
history information.

This application use the socket to send the signal and message.
